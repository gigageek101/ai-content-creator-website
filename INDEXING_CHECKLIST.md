## 💰 RENT MONEY TIMELINE

**Realistic expectations:**
- **Week 1:** Pages start getting indexed
- **Week 2-3:** Pages fully indexed, starting to rank
- **Week 4-8:** Ranking improves, traffic increases
- **Month 2-3:** Revenue potential starts

⚠️ **Important:** Google indexing alone won't immediately pay rent. You also need:
1. Traffic (SEO takes 2-3 months to build)
2. Conversions (people signing up for your beta)
3. Product launch (converting signups to paying customers)

**Short-term revenue options while waiting for SEO:**
- Run paid ads (Google Ads, Facebook Ads) → Immediate traffic
- Reach out directly to potential customers
- Post in communities where your target audience hangs out
- Partner with influencers for promotion

**Expected Indexing:** 3-7 days after deployment
